<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

We advise cellular systems because they're far more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
