<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop.
