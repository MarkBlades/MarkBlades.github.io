Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 1 month.

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of up to 90 seconds between videos.</p>
