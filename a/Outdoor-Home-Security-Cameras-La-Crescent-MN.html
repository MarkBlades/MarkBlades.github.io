When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which suggests. If somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
