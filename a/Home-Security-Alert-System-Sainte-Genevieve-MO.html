<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out smart device informs with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
