<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>

The 2nd number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and varies from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
