Keep an eye on your home, office, or store with our video surveillance systems. Use a desktop, laptop, tablet or choose smart device to gain access to live and taped video protection from a secure IP connection.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then broadcast over a local area network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
