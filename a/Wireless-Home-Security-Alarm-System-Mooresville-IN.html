<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to third party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified intruders or wild animals. Do you want to frighten them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice.

So, make certain you understand what you're getting into before you sign the dotted line.</p>
