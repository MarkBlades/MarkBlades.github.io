<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording video in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Equipment consists of things like your windows and door sensors, motion sensors, control panel, etc. The cost totally depends on which provider you choose, however expect to pay a few hundred dollars for a basic package--$ 200 would be considered cheap for a starter pack of home security equipment. That said, it can run cheaper if you choose a company that runs a great deal of offers on equipment (like Frontpoint). </p>
