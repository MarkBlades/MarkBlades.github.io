Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, a detailed knowledge of all the needed systems is required. If there are no as-built documents offering performance and setup info to make this integration work, there are only 2 options. The first alternative, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is unavailable or unwilling to offer those information) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to replace and rip, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
