<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.
