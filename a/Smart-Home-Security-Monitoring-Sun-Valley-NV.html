<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out signals, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as contacting property owners, notifying cops, or dispatching personal security forces. Such signals may be sent through devoted alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>
