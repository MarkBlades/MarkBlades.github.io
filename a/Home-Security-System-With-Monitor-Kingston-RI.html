<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
