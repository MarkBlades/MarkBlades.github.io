<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If catching footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>This design also includes a clever app that lets you see through the eyes of your cameras and rapidly record at any time. On the disadvantage, when motion detection is activated, its cameras are periodically overly sensitive and send out alerts even if very little movement outside has been spotted. Inside and outdoors, your home is secured with Swann Security. From discrete dome cameras to the iconic bullet cameras and smart video doorbells every angle is covered. </p>
