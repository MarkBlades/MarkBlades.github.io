<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
