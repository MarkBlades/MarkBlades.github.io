<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
