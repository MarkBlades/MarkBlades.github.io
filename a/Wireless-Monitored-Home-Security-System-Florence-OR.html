<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control panel (normally situated in the entrance hall) that is utilized to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have actually been set off, clever alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensors have been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours).
