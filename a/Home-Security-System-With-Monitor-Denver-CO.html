<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.
