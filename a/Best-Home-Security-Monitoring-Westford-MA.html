A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing trusted video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we invented security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're transforming the smart home. Firsts like Blue are what we do. Given that they're so certainly recognizable as a security camera, they're a fantastic deterrent as well, and they're easy to install almost anywhere.

<p>Many full-time" citizens with alarm systems inform us that they are home all the time" and wonder why they would require monitoring.
