<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the deck by a certified electrical expert (who takes place to be my spouse).
