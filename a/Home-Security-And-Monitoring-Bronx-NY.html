<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
