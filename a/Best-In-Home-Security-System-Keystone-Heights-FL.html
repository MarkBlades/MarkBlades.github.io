<p>Consider it this way, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low rate of forty dollars? It just does not build up. To use such low prices, producers need to cut corners, and completion result is compromised efficiency.

The significant disadvantage of IP cameras is their greater price.</p>
