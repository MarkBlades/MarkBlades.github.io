<p>Unlike wired security systems, wireless systems allow for on-the-go" monitoring of your system from a cell phone - anytime, anywhere.

<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded.

This choice is normally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is normally a paid service and the variety of hours it will save will depend on just how much cloud storage you want to spend for.</p>
