<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, vandalism, and theft. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of vision, the usual movement alerts, and a 90+ dB alarm that is most likely to scare off any approaching burglar before they've got too far into your home. When you're at home and don't desire to be tape-recorded, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
<p>Video surveillance is probably the next frontier for this innovation - and it's already readily available for enterprise-level video surveillance systems. Incorporating facial acknowledgment technology into security systems optimize convenience and safety. Your video surveillance monitoring group can respond better to prohibited, threatening, or suspicious individuals.
