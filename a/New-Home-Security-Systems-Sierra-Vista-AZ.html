<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
