<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance.

A wireless bridge is a great choice for long variety circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it must be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some cash - it does have actually a cable television attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit simpler to screw up for prospective intruders.
