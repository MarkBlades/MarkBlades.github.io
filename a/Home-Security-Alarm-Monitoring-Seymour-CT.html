<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm in Connecticut</h3>
<p>A little more expensive than our winning wise alarm, this system was practically as basic to install and, during testing, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if among the sensors had actually been set off.

There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have extra sensing units and key fobs, too.</p>
