<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level.
