<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
