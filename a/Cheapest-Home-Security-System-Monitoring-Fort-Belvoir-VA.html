<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously excellent piece of technology. For starters, it looks beautiful: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you envision a home security camera.

Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

This form of wireless communication works the same method as your cellular phone and counts on a cellular signal.
