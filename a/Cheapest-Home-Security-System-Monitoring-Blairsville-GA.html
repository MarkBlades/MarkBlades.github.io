Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security because it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
