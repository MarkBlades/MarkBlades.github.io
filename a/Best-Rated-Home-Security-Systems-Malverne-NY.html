<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer care experience varies widely depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
