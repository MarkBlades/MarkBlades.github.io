<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop.
