Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
