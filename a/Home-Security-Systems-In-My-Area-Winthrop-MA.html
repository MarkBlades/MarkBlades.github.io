<p>We likewise look at the functions that are offered through the camera's app. Does it have such things as adjustable motion zones? You don't want the camera recording video and informing you every time a car drives by if you live on a busy street.

<p>We do not like the rate. Vivint's month-to-month monitoring service strategies aren't too costly, however its equipment costs a quite penny. Prepare to shell out several hundred dollars for just your starter kit.

<p>SimpliSafe can not ensure against burglaries or theft, like most home security system companies (other than for ADT).
