<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.

Nevertheless, this is usually a paid service and the number of hours it will keep will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to spend for.</p>
