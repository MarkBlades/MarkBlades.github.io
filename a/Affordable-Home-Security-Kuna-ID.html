<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>Unmonitored alarm: These alarms create a loud sound that is audible both inside and outside the home. While they might frighten a burglar away, the disadvantage is that no one will be called to concern your home, and you will need to call emergency services yourself.

<p>Depending on how expansive the area is that you wish to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you select will need to show the landscape in order to provide a clear, beneficial image.
