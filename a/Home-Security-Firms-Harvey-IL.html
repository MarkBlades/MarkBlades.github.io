<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I have actually dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has detected intruders or wild animals.

<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same way as public cameras? We likewise need to draw fine lines about 'Who actually is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom could not do. They might peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing enjoying outside a window it might be a criminal offense, yet the same person might put a surveillance camera then from another location see a person within the privacy of their home.
