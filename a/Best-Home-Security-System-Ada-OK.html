<p>Throughout the spring and summer season, home security or alarm companies hire traveling sales agents to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "sales calls" on house owners.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
