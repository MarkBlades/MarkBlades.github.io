<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using convenience, comfort and satisfaction to every customer and are dedicated to fulfilling our consumer's needs with stability, sincerity, enthusiasm and exceptional service. Reliability has long been at the heart of the dispute over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's a dispute that's often manipulated by factors such as uncertainty over the vulnerability of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and glitches that trigger incorrect alarms. While improvements recently have made the innovation more robust and popular (some systems today have their own special wireless technology, which can't be hindered by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that don't impact hardwired systems.</p>
<p>Some property owners post decoy alarm signs hoping they'll hinder potential burglars. These signs might be affixed to a front door, a popular window, posted in the front yard, or at the top of a driveway.

<p>Whether you decide to choose a DIY system or opt for a professionally installed system, you'll need to pay a annual or month-to-month cost if you need monitoring, and sometimes, you'll be struck with a monthly fee to pay off the cost of hardware elements.

If you add monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly.
