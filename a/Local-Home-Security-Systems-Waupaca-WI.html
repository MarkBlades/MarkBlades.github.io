Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
