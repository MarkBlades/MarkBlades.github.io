<p>Bullet cameras are among the two most common CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and a distinctive appearance. This appearance is recognizable to nearly everyone and hence functions as a deterrent to unwanted individuals.

That being stated, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism due to the fact that of their apparent look. In addition, the shape of the camera is perfect for concentrating on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but requires several cameras if a user requires to see several fixed views.

<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, often use battery-powered transmitters which are easier to install and have cheaper start-up expenses, but may stop working if the batteries are not maintained. Depending upon distance and building and construction materials, one or more wireless repeaters might be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be transferred to a new home quickly, a benefit for those who rent or who move often. The more crucial wireless connection for security is the one in between the control board and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm protects versus a burglar cutting a cable or from failures of a web provider. This complete wireless setup is frequently referred to as 100% wireless.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
