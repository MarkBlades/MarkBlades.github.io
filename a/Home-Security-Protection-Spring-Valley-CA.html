<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for false alarms, and minimize the number of unneeded cops and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the professionals and must be teaching their customers how to effectively care and set for their alarm systems. National and local stats have proven that raising fines paid directly by homeowners and businesses have had no substantial effect on minimizing the number of incorrect alarms.
