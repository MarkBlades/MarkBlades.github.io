<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
