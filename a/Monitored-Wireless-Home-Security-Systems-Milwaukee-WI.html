<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
