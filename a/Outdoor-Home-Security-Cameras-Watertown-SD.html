<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which could be a cost effective alternative for consumers in rural areas. We advise cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the deck by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
