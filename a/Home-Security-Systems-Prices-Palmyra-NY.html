<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store.
