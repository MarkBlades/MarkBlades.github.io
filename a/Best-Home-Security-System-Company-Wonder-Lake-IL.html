We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.

<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.
