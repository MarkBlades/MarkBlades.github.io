<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for false alarms, and minimize the variety of unnecessary cops and fire actions.

This camera uses a wide variety of features consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the road.
