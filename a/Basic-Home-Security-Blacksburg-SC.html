<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
