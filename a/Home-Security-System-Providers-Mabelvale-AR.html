<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smart device alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
