The equipment's all offered by third parties, so what you get might be from a different manufacturer than the equipment your next-door neighbor received. Why's that? ADT uses an independent supplier model including third-party dealerships. The dealers figure out which equipment to utilize.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a concern.</p>
