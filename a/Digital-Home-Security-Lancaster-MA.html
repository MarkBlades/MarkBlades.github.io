<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
