<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're actually advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year agreement, however considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment.
