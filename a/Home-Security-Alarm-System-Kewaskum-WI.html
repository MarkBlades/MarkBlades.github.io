We initially noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens.
