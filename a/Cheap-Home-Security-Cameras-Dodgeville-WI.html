<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is among the most common sensing units discovered in household and small business environments. It uses inexpensive and trustworthy performance. The term passive refers to the truth that the detector does not create or radiate its own energy; it works entirely by spotting the heat energy released by other things. </p>
