<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
