<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the needed systems is required. There are only two options if there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup information to make this integration work. The very first option, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is unwilling or unavailable to provide those information) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system.
