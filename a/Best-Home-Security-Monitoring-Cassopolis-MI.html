For starters, it looks gorgeous: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely reminiscent of the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you imagine a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store.
