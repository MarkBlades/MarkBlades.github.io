However I also value minimalist systems that elements that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, wise lock, etc.), I wish to make certain that they all quickly interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
