<h3>Home Alarm Monitoring Companies Stanford CA 94305</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
<p>During the spring and summer months, home security or alarm companies hire traveling sales agents to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "sales calls" on property owners. In many cases, the salespeople usage misleading or high-pressure sales tactics to get potential clients to buy costly, and often substandard, systems or equipment they do not need.</p>
