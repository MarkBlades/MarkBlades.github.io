<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>Activity notifications notify the user whenever considerable activity is found near the camera. Find out if you can get alerts through push notifications, text, and or email. They'll keep you abreast of anything happening real-time near your camera. You'll also pay more for pro installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, especially for cameras. And to be honest, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the first location. What you're paying for is mainly that huge name in blue. </p>
