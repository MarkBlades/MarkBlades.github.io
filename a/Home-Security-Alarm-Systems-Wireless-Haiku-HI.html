<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set quantity of time, usually one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service contract.
