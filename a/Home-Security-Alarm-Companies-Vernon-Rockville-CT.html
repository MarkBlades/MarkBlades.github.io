<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
