<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

Or, if Arlo Pro spots a noise, you can have your lights set to switch on.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>Some self monitored alarm systems come with private sensors you can install in different rooms around your house. As such, they can provide very particular signals and warnings about issues in various spaces around your house.
