To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company need to be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical evidence like camera video or a damaged window to necessitate cops response.</p>
