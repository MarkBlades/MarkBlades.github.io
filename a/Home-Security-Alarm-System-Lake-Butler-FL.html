<p>The San Diego Cops Department wanted to access to footage from private and public cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego" surveillance program Since 2014, the program was filled with software compatibility problems, and officers had problem viewing footage in real time due to the fact that the department's police car did not have a 4G connection.

It costs a lot, its rates isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer service experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you opt for. </p>
