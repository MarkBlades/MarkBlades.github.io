We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
