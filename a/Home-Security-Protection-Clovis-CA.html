<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically safer, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially vulnerable. A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply wouldn't link. An aid window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint associate helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might tell there was a problem with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- however the associate asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control board over night.</p>
<p>Some homeowners post decoy alarm signs hoping they'll deter potential burglars. These signs may be attached to a front door, a prominent window, published in the front backyard, or at the top of a driveway.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
