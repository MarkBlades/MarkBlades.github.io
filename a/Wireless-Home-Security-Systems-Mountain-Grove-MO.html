I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump sum, because apparently they vehicle renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too expensive, and not fantastic.</p>
