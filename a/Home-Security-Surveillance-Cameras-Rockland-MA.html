<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users ought to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such incidents. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't think that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing recommendation.</p>

It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've labeled (after a knowing period).
