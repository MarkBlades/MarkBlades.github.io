<p>Increase safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. The Ring Stick Up Webcam is available in wired and battery variations, which can be used inside and outdoors. However neither can tape continually, and they both need the Ring Protect plan to capture recordings.
