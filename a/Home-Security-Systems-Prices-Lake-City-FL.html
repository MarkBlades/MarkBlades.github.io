<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the limited range of sensors. A lot of radio frequencies are weak outside a range of 500 feet.

<p>The biggest, baddest function is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which provides you incredibly crisp, clear video footage that lets you zoom in on details like faces and license plates without messing up your image quality.
