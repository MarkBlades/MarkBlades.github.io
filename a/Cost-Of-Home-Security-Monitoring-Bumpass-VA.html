<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
