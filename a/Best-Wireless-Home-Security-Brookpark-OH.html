<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.

Nevertheless, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the customer. </p>
