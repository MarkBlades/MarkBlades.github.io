<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple locations around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.

Although FrontPoint offers a wide range of equipment and home automation products at a sensible price, the one area where the company especially stands out remains in DIY installation. </p>
