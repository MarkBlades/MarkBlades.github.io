'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could not do. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it might be a criminal offense, yet the same individual could put a surveillance camera then remotely see an individual within the personal privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the chastening code.</p>

When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smart device (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable rate, the one location where the company especially stands out remains in DIY installation. </p>
