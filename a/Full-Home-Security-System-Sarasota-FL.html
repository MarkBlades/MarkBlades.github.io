Dependability has long been at the heart of the dispute over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's a dispute that's typically manipulated by elements such as uncertainty over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and glitches that trigger incorrect alarms.

Properly established, it should be safe to allow access to the local network to outsiders.</p>
