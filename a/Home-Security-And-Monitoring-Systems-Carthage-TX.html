<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send signals, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even activate incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place regularly enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered into the camera controls, I was reasonably pleased. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the person being seen know they're being watched, and you can choose to tape video clips or photos and save them to your smart device on an impulse. </p>
