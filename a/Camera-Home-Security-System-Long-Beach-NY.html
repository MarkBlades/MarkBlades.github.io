ADT: Many popular-- ADT is incredibly costly for what you get, particularly if you choose ADT Command. But, like Vivint, ADT comes expertly installed and its monitoring centers are incredibly trustworthy.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a little bit more if you want to add additional features, like a security camera. While a typical agreement runs 42 months (among the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who wish to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is essential. In reality, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Having the ability to distinguish between an individual and an automobile, for instance, allows you to reduce unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, a doorway, and even garbage cans. </p>
