The latter enables you to see exactly when a specific person arrives at the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to introduce a clever smoke alarm and siren later this year, which makes this an even much better proposal.</p>
