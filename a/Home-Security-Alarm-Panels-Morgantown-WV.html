<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to 3rd party companies?

Lennar, as it occurs, is directly linked now on Amazon's security homepage, but to be clear, the offering is not special to Lennar house owners. </p>
