<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you opt for a three-year agreement, but because Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you know you'll stay put for at least three years. But if you might upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>

Having the ability to distinguish between an automobile and a person, for example, allows you to cut down on unneeded informs. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
