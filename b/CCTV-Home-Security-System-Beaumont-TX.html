<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
