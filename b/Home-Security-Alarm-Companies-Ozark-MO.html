<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier.
