<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. It activates the doorbell camera when someone sounds the doorbell. That video can go to your mobile phone, computer, or to a screen inside your home. Doorbell cameras are part of numerous home automated systems and offer an additional layer of protection. These cameras frequently come with two-way talk, night vision, and a built-in motion sensing unit. Similar to any security camera, take a look at the video resolution and field of vision.

Hence the exposure is low with an open wireless access point, and the threats with having an open wireless network are small.

<p>It depends on the size and design of the monitoring and the home objectives. The benefits of cameras are that you can get visual verification of any activity happening inside or outside the home.

<p>When combined with face recognition, surveillance camera networks raise additional personal privacy and civil rights concerns-- especially because face recognition information is prone to mistake.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
