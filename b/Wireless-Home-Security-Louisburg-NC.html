<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>If you decide for a professionally installed system, a security company will make more money. Generally, in this circumstances, a security company will usually provide you the equipment totally free and provide you with a totally free installation. However, in exchange, they will require you to sign a long-lasting monitoring contract. Therefore, you will need to be willing to sign a long-lasting agreement and spend for that service. </p>
