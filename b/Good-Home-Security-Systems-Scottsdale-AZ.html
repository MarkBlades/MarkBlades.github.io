<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center.

Most monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow response times.</p>
<p>When selecting a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other major decision. Outdoor cameras will frequently be built to be more durable and able to make it through rain, frost, or damp. The drawback of outdoor cameras is that they're usually mains powered and require expert installation.

<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in locations where they are believed to be most reliable, which typically consists of highly inhabited towns, city centers, car parks, or various other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Considered that the positioning of these cameras is extremely important, the crime patterns in locations of interest are normally studied for amount of times to identify crime hotspots where cameras might possibly be put.
