<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly attempted to give it an appealing edge, and we need to offer credit to its capability to show what's going on from approximately 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and awkward to use on occasion - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times.

Absolutely one of the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
