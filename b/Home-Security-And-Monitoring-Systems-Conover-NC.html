<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've dropped my Nest Cams since they were purchased by Google. Something all of us need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified burglars or wild animals.
