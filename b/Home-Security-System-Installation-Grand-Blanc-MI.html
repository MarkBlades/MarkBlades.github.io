The instructions are very detailed and the 200m variety of the alarm means it can be used to secure garages and sheds in addition to your home.

Commercial cameras outshine their cheaper cousins because they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adjust and record exceptional low light video.</p>
<p>I feel this is an inexpensive method to go if you don't want monitored name brand alarm. This in addition to lawn signs and window stickers (sold on Amazon) might be enough to deter small time crooks.

Think about asking next-door neighbors for recommendations on security systems too. They might even recommend a local company with a strong track record that can expertly install the equipment.</p>
<p>Wireless systems are easier take with you when you move due to the fact that there's no requirement to drill and run wires throughout installation.

Many cameras use IR (infrared) LEDs to deliver black-and-white night video, but there are a few out there that use white light to deliver full-color night video. Look for a camera with a night vision series of a minimum of 30 feet.</p>
