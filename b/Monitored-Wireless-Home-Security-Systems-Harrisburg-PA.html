<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this article, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible. On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't add a lots of other smart home tech to the system. It won't deal with loads of wise home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you journey the motion sensor in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is incredibly sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
