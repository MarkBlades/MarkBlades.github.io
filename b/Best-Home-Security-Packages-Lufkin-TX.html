<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
