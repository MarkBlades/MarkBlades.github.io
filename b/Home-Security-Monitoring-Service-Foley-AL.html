<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who actually is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody!

If an individual was standing watching outside a window it might be a criminal offense, yet the very same person could put a surveillance camera then remotely see a person within the privacy of their home. Most notably, it is not against the chastening code.</p>
<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. But beyond that I just had problems.

I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about 2 minutes prior to it even noticed I existed. </p>
