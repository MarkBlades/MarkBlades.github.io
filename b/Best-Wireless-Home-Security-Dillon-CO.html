<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
