<p>I described that all we would require to do is take advantage of any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if needed, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
