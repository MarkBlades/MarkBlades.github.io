Amazon pitches a machine-learning product called DeepLens," a deep-learning allowed camera for designers that can be incorporated with another of its machine-learning items, SageMaker," to increase the inter-operability of numerous information analytics programs from the videofeeds.</p>

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your general security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can manage your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
