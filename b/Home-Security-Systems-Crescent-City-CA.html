Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, wise lock, and so on), I wish to make sure that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

There are only two choices if there are no as-built files providing functionality and setup information to make this combination work.
