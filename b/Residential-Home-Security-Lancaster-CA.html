With a wireless system, you can also get push notifications on your phone or tablet that let you understand there is a problem, even when you're not in your home.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
