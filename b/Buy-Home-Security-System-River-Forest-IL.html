<h3>The Best Home Security in Illinois</h3>
<p>Ring might not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), however it sure has gained rather the fanfare over the years. We've been checking Ring Alarm quite a bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security kit that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you pick the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>

<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape; whatever within their focus capability is caught.
