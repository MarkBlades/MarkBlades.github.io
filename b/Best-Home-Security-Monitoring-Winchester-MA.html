<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is necessary. In reality, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.
