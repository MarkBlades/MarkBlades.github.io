But suicide attackers are plainly not prevented by video cameras - and may even be brought in to the tv coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the limited advantages that the system may supply in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
