<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
