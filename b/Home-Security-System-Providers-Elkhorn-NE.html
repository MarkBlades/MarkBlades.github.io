It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning duration).
