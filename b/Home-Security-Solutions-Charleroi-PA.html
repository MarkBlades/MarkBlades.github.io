<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
