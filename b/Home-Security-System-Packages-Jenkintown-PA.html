It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer a number of other benefits over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and allows for systems to be scaled up much more quickly than can be done with DVR.
