<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the specific same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
