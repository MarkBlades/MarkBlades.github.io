<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. Here's another impressive wireless security feature-- the Motion Detector. These infrared devices are installed inside your home. The alarm sounds and you'll get an alert when they discover motion. Feel confident, if there's any motion or commotion, you'll be the very first to know. The very best motion detectors can distinguish between family pets and people, and some even boast facial acknowledgment technology.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract might be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems typically do not featured upfront costs. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts!

<h3>Security System Equipment in District Heights MD</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control board (generally located in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have actually been triggered, smart alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours).

<p>The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's left to the company's courteous, knowledgeable professionals. Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was respectful, prompt, and sincere (even reducing his costs after recognizing they didn't require to install one camera).
