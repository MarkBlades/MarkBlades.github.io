<h3>Home Automation Security Los Gatos CA 95032</h3>
<p>The Ring Floodlight Web cam integrates two important gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds movement, it switches on its two powerful LED beams in addition to its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Web cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk to whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their reactions.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered the camera controls, I was reasonably amazed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the person being viewed know they're being viewed, and you can choose to tape video or photos and conserve them to your wise gadget on an impulse. </p>
