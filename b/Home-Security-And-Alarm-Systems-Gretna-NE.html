<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For beginners, Deep Learning permits somebody to find what they are looking for without needing to search through hours of useless video footage.  Envision a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are searching for in the taped video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we merely type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have a powerful option for collecting and catching wrongdoers proof.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see so many growing companies branching off and attempting new things in the home security area. But ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer care experience varies widely depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
