<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
