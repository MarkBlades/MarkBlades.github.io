<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even set off false alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place regularly enough. Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
