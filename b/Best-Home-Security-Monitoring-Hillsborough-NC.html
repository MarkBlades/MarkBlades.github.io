<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more pricey for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
<p>Blue by ADT uses tailored Do It Yourself home security equipment that can be customized to your current lifestyle with the ability to grow, move, and adjust to your developing requirements-- all backed by 145 years of proficiency. In either case, there's no agreement and you can cancel your service at any time without any charges.

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer support experience differs commonly depending on the dealership you opt for. </p>
