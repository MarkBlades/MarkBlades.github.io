<p>To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm is valuable. Although there are a variety of extra system components available consisting of smoke detectors and wireless security cameras, the basic alarm system consists of three main components: a keypad control board, individual sensing units, and a manned monitoring station.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web procedure (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day model of analog cameras, and while the private cameras tend to be a bit more expensive, they provide a variety of functions that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the differences in between the 2 types of camera.</p>

<p>An on-site ringer will typically activate a bell or siren connected to the building when the alarm is tripped. Similarly, when an automated dialer alarm is tripped, a phone conversation is immediately positioned to the authorities or fire departments, and a pre-recorded announcement is played when that call is answered. Automatic dialer alarms are not allowed to dial 9-1-1.</p>

<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not included in this new law. These alarms differ from panic alarms, which are covered. Panic alarms receive cops response based upon worry of impending injury or physical harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms generally get fire reaction based upon an emergency situation due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
<p>When your camera are set up, you can pick whether your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you select to have your cameras monitored (this is generally done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is set off. However, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is normally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the customer. </p>
