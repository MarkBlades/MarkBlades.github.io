<h2>What Does Battery Life Have To Do With Security Cameras East Aurora</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
