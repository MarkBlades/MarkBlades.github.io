<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a complimentary tier of cloud storage, so you need to spend at least $3 per month if you want to save any videos. And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera each month, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year.

If you add monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month.
