<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a complimentary tier of cloud storage, so you need to spend at least $3 per month if you want to save any videos. And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera each month, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year. However if you desire the outright best when it concerns video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
<p>We believe customer care is our first priority, and we will constantly provide you the white glove treatment.

<p>Whether you decide to choose a Do It Yourself system or choose a professionally set up system, you'll need to pay a regular monthly or annual  fee if you need monitoring, and in many cases, you'll be struck with a monthly charge to pay off the cost of hardware parts. With many DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Package, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you commit to a three-year contract. Ring's Protect Plus plan opts for $10 each month and does not require a contract.</p>
