<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency given that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
