If you're using a home automation hub to manage things like lighting and thermostats, you can include a Z-Wave or Zigbee clever lock to the system without much effort. At the same time, if you don't have a home automation hub, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that includes its own mobile app. Smart locks use standard pre-drilled holes and are relatively easy to install.
