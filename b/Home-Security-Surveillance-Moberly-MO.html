<p>Primarily, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's much better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the cost. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically 2 years of use, day and night images have always been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when checking the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.
