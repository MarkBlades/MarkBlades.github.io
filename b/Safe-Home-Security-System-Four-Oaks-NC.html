<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
