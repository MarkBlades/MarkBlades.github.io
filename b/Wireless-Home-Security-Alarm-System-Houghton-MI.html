We have actually been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit recently, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you pick the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present suggestion.</p>
