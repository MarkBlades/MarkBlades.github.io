<p>The Randolph Municipality Police Department is asking companies and locals to register their privately-owned surveillance camera systems. As our officers respond to reports of criminal activity in our neighborhood, they might be able to use the details or video recorded on these security cameras to assist in the apprehension and prosecution of the wrongdoers included.</p>

'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody!

If an individual was standing watching outside a window it could be a crime, yet the same person might position a surveillance camera then from another location view an individual within the personal privacy of their home.

In spite of a basic improvement in wireless innovation, there appear to be less ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and paralyzed. </p>
