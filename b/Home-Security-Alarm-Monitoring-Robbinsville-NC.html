<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the basics. However while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems do not.

However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>

The camera consists of features like totally free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it doesn't take snapshots of activity and can't pan or move-- basic functions discovered on many surveillance cameras. </p>
