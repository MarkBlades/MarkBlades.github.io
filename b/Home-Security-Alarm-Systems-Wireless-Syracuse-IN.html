<p>It deals with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate indoors or inside - you get a great deal of flexibility from this little device. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of view, the motion detection, and the removable magnetic base which is basic to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the reassurance of expert monitoring.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone informs with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
