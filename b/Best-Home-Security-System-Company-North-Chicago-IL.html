<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
