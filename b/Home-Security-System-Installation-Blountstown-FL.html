<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android smartphone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide range of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable cost, the one area where the company particularly excels remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
