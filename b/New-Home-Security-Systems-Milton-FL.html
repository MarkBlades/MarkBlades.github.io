<h3>Wireless House Alarm Milton FL 32571</h3>

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition.

After a while, the camera will discover to identify those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
