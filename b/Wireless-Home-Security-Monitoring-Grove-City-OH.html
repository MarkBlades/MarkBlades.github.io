<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
