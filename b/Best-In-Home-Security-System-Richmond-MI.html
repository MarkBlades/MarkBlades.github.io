Nowadays, it's much easier to have a standalone security camera.

Other gadgets permit hackers to generate radio sound that can jam communications between the sensing units and the center.</p>
<p>No matter the resolution, try to pick a camera with a relatively wide field of view (seeing angle) and make sure it can record clear night vision video. Many cameras use IR (infrared) LEDs to provide black-and-white night video, however there are a few out there that usage white light to deliver full-color night video. Look for a camera with a night vision series of at least 30 feet.</p>
