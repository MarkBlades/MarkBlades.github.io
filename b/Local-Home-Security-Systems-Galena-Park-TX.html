Dependability has actually long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's frequently skewed by elements such as uncertainty over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and problems that trigger false alarms.

With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
