<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
