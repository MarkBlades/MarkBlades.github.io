<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
