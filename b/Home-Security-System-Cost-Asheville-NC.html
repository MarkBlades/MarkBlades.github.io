<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to overlook objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
