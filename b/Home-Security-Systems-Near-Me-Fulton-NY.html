<h3>Wireless Home Security in New York</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's statistics considering that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit limited to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>ADT uses one of the biggest sets of equipment options on the market. Higher-tier packages include smart device apps, clever home integration, camera choices and more. We value how ADT's Command panel (available in the Control plan and higher) doubles as a Z-wave smart home center, so you can set up compatible devices from other makers.</p>
