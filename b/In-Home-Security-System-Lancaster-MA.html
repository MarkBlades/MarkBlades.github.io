By integrating LiveWatch Do It Yourself security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security competing with other big names in the industry.

We have actually encountered a couple of technical problems while long-lasting testing the Home Iota, and so will continue to check and upgrade appropriately. We no longer recommend it.</p>
<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost.
