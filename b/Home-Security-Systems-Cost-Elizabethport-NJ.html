<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smart device signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
