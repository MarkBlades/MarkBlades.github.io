<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

We first saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out informs, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
