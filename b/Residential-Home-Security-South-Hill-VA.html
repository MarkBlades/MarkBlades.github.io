If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't believe that these issues modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our current suggestion.</p>
