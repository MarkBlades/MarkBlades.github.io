<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of innovation. For beginners, it looks lovely: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might recollect when you envision a home security camera. The very first wireless function to consider is the security system and its components, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring part was hard-wired back to a panel box.

So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
