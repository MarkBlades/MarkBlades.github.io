The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically two years of usage, day and night images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered.

The highest photo quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
