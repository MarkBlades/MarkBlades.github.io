When you imagine a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.

Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
