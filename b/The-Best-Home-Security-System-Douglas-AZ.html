<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send alerts, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the porch by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
