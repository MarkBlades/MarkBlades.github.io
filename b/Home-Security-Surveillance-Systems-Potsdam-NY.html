We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
