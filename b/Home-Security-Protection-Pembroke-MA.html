<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months.</p>
<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is between tape-recording and spotting movement. It takes a 2nd for the camera to really turn on when it discovers motion since the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording. If a nefarious wrongdoer was quick enough, they could get past the camera prior to it had time to tape them.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor.
