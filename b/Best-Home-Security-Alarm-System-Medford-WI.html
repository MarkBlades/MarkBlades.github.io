<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
