Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower price if you choose a three-year contract, however considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So pick what will be the better offer for you. If you know you'll stay put for at least 3 years, choose the agreement and enjoy those savings.
