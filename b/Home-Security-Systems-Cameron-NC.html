<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
