<p>Blue cameras work with Alexa and IFTTT only. Apple HomeKit compatibility coming soon to all Blue cameras. For too long, the wise home hasn't been extremely clever. It's made complex to set up and manage, with a lot of various devices that do not work well together. So we're streamlining things and combining all Nest and Google Home products under one roofing system. Presenting Google Nest. Invite to the practical home.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually identified (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
