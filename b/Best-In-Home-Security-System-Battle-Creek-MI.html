<p>Home security should never ever be restricted by where you can put or power your cameras, inside or outdoors.

Convenience is the major reason people switch to wireless," says Du, and it's tough to argue against a 10-minute setup when the wired option requires expert installation of wires beneath your house.</p>
<p>Something that needs to be considered when setting up CCTV cameras is how they will be powered, and how wiring will be run throughout the structure.

Other tasks will demand using avenue - piping for running the electrical wiring and securing it - and sometimes, tearing out part of the wall to lay electrical wiring inside. For these bigger tasks, expert security installation is normally the best choice.</p>
