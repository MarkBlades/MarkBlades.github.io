This is a pricey security camera, however we think it's worth the investment. Increasing deployment of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Numerous sites needing alarm setups no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
