<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly charge for a set amount of time, usually one to five years.

These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service agreement. Paying for the equipment in advance supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as lot of times as you want.</p>
