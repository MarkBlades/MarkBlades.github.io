<p>When picking a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other significant decision. Outdoor cameras will typically be built to be more able and resilient to endure rain, frost, or damp.

Cameras are pretty standard for self monitored alarm systems, particularly because false alarms is a very real possibility.</p>

IP cameras primarily use security camera wire kinds of Cat5 or Cat6, and even NO wires at all. Most alarm companies that will install a customer security system normally charge a $99 installation fee plus monthly monitoring charges.</p>
