<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
