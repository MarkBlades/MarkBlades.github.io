<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>The price of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, because it consists of three outdoor cameras with two-way audio.

That person at Deep Guard's center can alert a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
