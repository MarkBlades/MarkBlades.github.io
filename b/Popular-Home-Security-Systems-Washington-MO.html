<p>I explained that all we would require to do is take advantage of any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.
