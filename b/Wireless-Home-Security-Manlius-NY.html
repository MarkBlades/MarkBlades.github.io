<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple locations around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smartphone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a variety of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable rate, the one area where the company especially stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
