<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level.

Because items are hardly ever specifically the exact same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will look like distinct in a thermal image.</p>
