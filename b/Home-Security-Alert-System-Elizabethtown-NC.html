<h3>Home Video Security Systems in Elizabethtown NC</h3>
<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology. For starters, it looks gorgeous: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you think of a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind. The very first wireless function to consider is the security system and its components, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring part was hard-wired back to a panel box. This indicated every windows and door needed its own wire and course of holes through your house.</p>
<p>IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address, capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio).

In today age, usage of security cameras has become unavoidable at houses, going shopping malls, roads, offices and so on</p>
