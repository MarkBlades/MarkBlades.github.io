<p>Expenses for systems differ. Bigger systems that provide full-house coverage with expert monitoring are the most costly options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most cost effective option. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies.

Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if required, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
