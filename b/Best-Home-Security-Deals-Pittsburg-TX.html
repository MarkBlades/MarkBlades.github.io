Asset protection gadgets are developed to protect specific, tangible possessions, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and household treasures. These gadgets can be outfitted with anti-tampering innovation to avoid being disarmed.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment prices is incredibly affordable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
