Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
