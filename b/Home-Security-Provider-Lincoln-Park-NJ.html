When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out smartphone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
