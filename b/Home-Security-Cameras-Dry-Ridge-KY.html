<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
