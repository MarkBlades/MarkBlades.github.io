One common area is near a dumpster-a worker may get rid of the stolen products only to retrieve them later or send out an accomplice for the retrieval.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period).

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
