<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range.
