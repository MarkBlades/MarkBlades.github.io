<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
