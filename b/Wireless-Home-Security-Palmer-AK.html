<p>One of the best aspects of this alarm system is that it has a very innovative motion sensor. It only gets activated when a human is available in close proximity because it uses infrared sensors and mass detection to separate in between people and other inanimate things or smaller living things.

But I likewise value minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, clever lock, etc.), I wish to ensure that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
