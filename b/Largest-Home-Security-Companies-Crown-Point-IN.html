<p>This nifty smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we found it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was discovered. We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector.

It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service offered.</p>
