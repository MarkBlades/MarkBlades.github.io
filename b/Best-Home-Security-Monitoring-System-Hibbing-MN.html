<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to third party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something we all require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Keep in mind that these sirens might violate local noise control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>False alarms are expensive for the City of Plymouth. Cops respond to thousands of incorrect alarms each year.
