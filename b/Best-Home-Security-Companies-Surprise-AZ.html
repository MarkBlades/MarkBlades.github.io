<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly frustrating.

I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that apparently they car renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a headache, method too expensive, and not fantastic.</p>
