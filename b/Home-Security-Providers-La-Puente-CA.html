<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is tap into any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system.

In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, might simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
