<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
