<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more expensive for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>

This option is normally cost-free. A cloud storage choice saves your video in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is generally a paid service and the variety of hours it will store will depend upon just how much cloud storage you are willing to spend for.</p>
