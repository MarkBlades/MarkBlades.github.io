<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system.
