We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion.
