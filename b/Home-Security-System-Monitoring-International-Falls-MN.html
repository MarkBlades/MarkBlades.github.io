Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
