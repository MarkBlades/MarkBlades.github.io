<h3>Largest Home Security Companies in New York</h3>
<p>Ring might not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has actually gained quite the fanfare over the years. We've been evaluating Ring Alarm quite a bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security kit that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you pick the totally free self-monitor" choice.</p>
<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not believe that these issues change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present suggestion.</p>
