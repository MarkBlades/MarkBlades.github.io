<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>

If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we do not think that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
