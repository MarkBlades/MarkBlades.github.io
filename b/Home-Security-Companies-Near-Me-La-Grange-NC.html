<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
