<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>Security cameras are suggested to be discreet devices. Some have protective dome lenses and others have night vision innovation. Some individuals choose a whole surveillance and security system, which is normally comprised of several cameras for outdoor and indoor usage and a multi-channel DVR base for recording footage.
