<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is important.

Being able to compare an individual and an automobile, for example, permits you to reduce unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
