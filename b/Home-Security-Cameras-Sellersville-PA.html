<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall.

These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
