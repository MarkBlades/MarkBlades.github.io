<p>In spite of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 ends up being more costly overall per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it since its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then broadcast over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>The integration of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural convergence of security technologies.

An image of that worker is presented on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating occurs.</p>
