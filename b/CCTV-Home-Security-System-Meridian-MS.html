<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is required for transmitting video footage from the CCTV security cameras. This is among the drawbacks of analog CCTV video surveillance, as the cable can be hard and expensive to install, particularly for bigger camera networks, and those were cameras need to be positioned in hard locations. The company sends an authorized technician with an average of 11 years experience to examine the home and install the equipment when clients acquire one of ADT's security packages.
