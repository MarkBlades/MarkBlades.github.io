<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers realize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
