<p>Among the best aspects of this alarm is that it has an extremely innovative motion sensor. Because it uses infrared sensors and mass detection to differentiate in between people and other inanimate items or smaller sized living things, it only gets set off when a human comes in close proximity. If your motion sensor is set off, you get an alert in your smartphone app. There's no latency so you get informed instantly so you can take immediate actions such as setting off a loud alarm, contacting the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to speak with the prospective burglars.</p>

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range.
