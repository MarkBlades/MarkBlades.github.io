<p>The disadvantage? It's extremely simple to devote security errors that will leave your home susceptible. The moment you drive out of signal range or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the minute you have actually left your house open. This open hole in your security can show to be a huge problem if you aren't cautious. With a monitored system, that wouldn't be a concern.
