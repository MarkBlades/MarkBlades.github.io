<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users must reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such occurrences. However, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not believe that these problems modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current recommendation.</p>
