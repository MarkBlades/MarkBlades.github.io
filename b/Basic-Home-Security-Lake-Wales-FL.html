<p>Nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not have to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your home and belongings. On the occasion that your alarm system is set off, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security experts are waiting to react by instantly connecting with you and if need be, the local medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensing units, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
