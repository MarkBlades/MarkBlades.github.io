<p>Their cameras arbitrarily loose" the memory stick inside of them, leading to your whole footage being deleted.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to spot it.
