<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. However suicide assaulters are plainly not deterred by video cameras - and might even be brought in to the tv protection cameras can make sure - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the restricted advantages that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>Another crucial topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much is enough.
