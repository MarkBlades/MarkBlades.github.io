<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms happen.
