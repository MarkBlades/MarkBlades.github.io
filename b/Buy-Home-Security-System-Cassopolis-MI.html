<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then shops it on a hard disk for later retrieval. Displays can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to communicate via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

Commercial cameras outperform their less expensive cousins due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adapt and capture exceptional low light video.</p>
<p>Identity theft (or MAC spoofing) happens when a hacker is able to listen in on network traffic and identify the MAC address of a computer with network opportunities The majority of wireless systems enable some kind of MAC filtering to allow just authorized computer systems with specific MAC IDs to gain access and make use of the network. Nevertheless, programs exist that have network sniffing" abilities.
